# Servy

Servy lets you run any app as a native Windows service with full control over working directory, startup type, process priority, logging, health checks, environment variables, dependencies, pre-launch scripts and parameters. An open-source alternative to NSSM and FireDaemon.

Servy offers both a GUI and a Command-Line Interface (CLI), allowing you to create, configure, and manage Windows services either interactively or through scripts and CI/CD pipelines. Additionally, it provides a Manager interface for quickly monitoring and managing all installed services.

If you've ever struggled with the limitations of the built-in `sc` tool or found NSSM lacking in features or UI, Servy might be exactly what you need. It solves a common limitation of Windows services by allowing you to set a custom working directory. The built-in `sc` tool only works with applications specifically designed to run as Windows services and always uses `C:\Windows\System32` with no way to change it. This can break apps that depend on relative paths, configuration files, or local assets. Servy lets you run any app as a service and define the startup directory explicitly, ensuring it behaves exactly as if launched from a shortcut or command prompt.

Servy lets you run an optional script or executable before the main service starts. This is useful for preparing configurations, fetching secrets, or performing other setup tasks. If the pre-launch script fails, the service will not start unless you enable Ignore Failure option.

Servy continuously monitors your app, restarting it automatically if it crashes, hangs, or stops. It is perfect for keeping non-service apps running in the background without having to rewrite them as services. Use it to run Node.js, Python, .NET, Java, Go, Rust, PHP, or Ruby applications; keep web servers, background workers, sync tools, or daemons alive after reboots; and automate task runners, schedulers, or scripts in production with built-in health checks, logging, and restart policies.
