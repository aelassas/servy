Servy lets you run any app as a native Windows service with full control over the working directory, startup type, process priority, logging, health checks, environment variables, dependencies, pre-launch and post-launch hooks, and parameters. It's designed to be a full-featured alternative to NSSM, WinSW, and FireDaemon Pro.

Servy offers a desktop app, a CLI, and a PowerShell module that let you create, configure, and manage Windows services interactively or through scripts and CI/CD pipelines. It also includes a Manager app for easily monitoring and managing all installed services in real time.

If you've ever struggled with the limitations of the built-in `sc` tool or found NSSM lacking in features or UI, Servy might be exactly what you need. It solves a common limitation of Windows services by allowing you to set a custom working directory. The built-in `sc` tool only works with applications specifically designed to run as Windows services and always uses `C:\Windows\System32` with no way to change it. This can break apps that depend on relative paths, configuration files, or local assets. Servy lets you run any app as a service and define the startup directory explicitly, ensuring it behaves exactly as if launched from a shortcut or command prompt.

Servy continuously monitors your app, restarting it automatically if it crashes, hangs, or stops. It is perfect for keeping non-service apps running in the background and ensuring they start automatically at system boot without having to rewrite them as services. Use it to run Node.js, Python, .NET, Java, Go, Rust, PHP, or Ruby applications; keep web servers, background workers, sync tools, or daemons alive after reboots; and automate task runners, schedulers, or scripts in production with built-in health checks, logging, and restart policies.

## Why?

See the [project manifest](MANIFEST.md).

## Getting Started
You have two options to install Servy. Download and [install manually](https://github.com/aelassas/servy/wiki/Installation-Guide#manual-download-and-install) or use a package manager such as WinGet, Chocolatey, or Scoop.

Make sure you have [WinGet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/), [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) installed.

Run one of the following commands as administrator from Command Prompt or PowerShell:

**WinGet**
```powershell
winget install servy
```

**Chocolatey**
```powershell
choco install -y servy
```

**Scoop**
```powershell
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install servy
```
